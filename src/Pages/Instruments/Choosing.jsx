      <Text
        title="Identify Your Musical Interests:"
        text="Start by thinking about the type of music you enjoy. Different instruments are commonly associated with specific genres. For example, if you love classical music, you might consider piano or violin. If you're into rock, you could explore electric guitar or drums."
      />

      <Text
        title="Consider Your Musical Goals:"
        text="Determine your goals for learning an instrument. Are you looking to play for fun, join a band, or become a professional musician? Your goals will influence your instrument choice."
      />

      <Text
        title="Budget:"
        text="Consider your budget. Some instruments are more affordable than others, and the cost of lessons and maintenance can vary. Research the cost of the instrument itself, lessons, and any additional accessories.."
      />

      <Text
        title="Physical Factors:"
        text="Your physical characteristics can also play a role in instrument selection. For instance, if you have small hands, a large guitar neck might be less comfortable. The reach for certain piano pieces can also be challenging if you have small hands."
      />

      <Text
        title="Acoustic vs. Electronic:"
        text="Decide whether you prefer an acoustic or electronic instrument. Acoustic instruments like guitars, pianos, and violins produce sound naturally. Electronic instruments like synthesizers and electronic drums produce sound through amplification and digital processing."
      />

      <Text
        title="Try Different Instruments:"
        text="Visit a music store and try out different instruments. Play a few notes or chords to see which ones feel more comfortable and sound appealing to you. This hands-on experience can be enlightening."
      />

      <Text
        title="Consider Your Living Situation:"
        text="Think about where you live. Some instruments can be loud and may not be suitable for apartment living. Electronic instruments with headphone options can be a quieter choice."

      <Text
        title="Influence of Musical Idols:"
        text="If you have musical idols or favorite bands, consider the instruments they play. This can be a source of inspiration."
      />
      <Text
        title="Maintenance:"
        text="Different instruments require varying levels of maintenance. Woodwinds and brass instruments need regular cleaning, while pianos may need tuning. Consider the time and effort you're willing to invest in maintenance."
      />
      <Text
        title="Time Commitment:"
        text="Be realistic about the time you can commit to practice. Some instruments require more time and effort than others to become proficient."
